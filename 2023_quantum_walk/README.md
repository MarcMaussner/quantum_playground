This is the folder storing some basic samples about quantum walks.
Contents of Quantum_Walk.ipynb:
- first thoughts of quantum walks
- classical implementation with coin toss via numpy random
- calculation with markov-chain
- first approach quantum implementation:
  * coin toss with hadamard
  * count only possible solutions to determine probability
- second approach quantum implementation:
  * use oracle with phase kickback
  * measure only output qubit ("0", "1") to determine probability
